### More about

Inspired by the story of Joseph of Egypt, who interpreted dreams, the Joseph Project was created with the purpose of anticipating environmental crises in the Amazon. 

By analyzing vast sets of historical data, NASA satellite data, studies and other diverse data in real time, our model predicts climate and hydrological events, generating important insights, allowing decision-makers and local communities to prepare for and mitigate impacts.

Vitor Hugo Schunemann, a biologist graduated from the Federal University of Santa Maria (UFSM) and has a master's degree in tropical ecology from the National Institute of Amazonian Research (INPA). 

I ​​work in the field of theoretical and applied ecology, especially developing computational models applied to biology. 

Predictive theoretical models about future ecosystem conditions are some of the things that motivate me most within environmental sciences, and being able to combine them with artificial intelligence in order to serve the public good is a unique opportunity.
